// TODO: accept a single ref of FROM element and a single ref of TO element;
// We might have 2 arrows, one for left and right key (Left shift + right p);
// Starting point to decide where to point an arrow will be the next key to press. I have only 8 spots from where I need to make an arrow
// Binary search by positions on the keyboard?
// Another idea: make each key to have its own anchor key before, save in data structure the just map
