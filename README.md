# 10 Fingers practice

Pet project to get caught up on current frontend tech as well as to get myself an instrument to finally force myself to drill 10 fingers keyboard input.

## TODO:
1. Make an extensible and flexible webpack config with good optimizations for the prod build. Add prettier, eslint, husky, automate all linting. Add cashing;
2. Write a custom SCSS grid system to closely represent mac keyboard layout;
3. Add theming (black/white, maybe ability to customize?);
4. Make possible to train with some default exercises as well as add your own. Should be possible to customize for different layouts/languages;
5. Invent some rating system based on speed/number of errors/complexity of an exercise;
6. Based on rating and other stats show graphs, list of attempts, dates of attempts etc;
7. Implement centralized and serializable state, should be adaptable for localStorage/DB.
8. Dockerize.
